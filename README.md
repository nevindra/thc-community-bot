# Tech Hangout Community Bot

Hi there! This is the repository for the Tech Hangout Community Bot.
You are welcome to contribute to this project by submitting a pull request.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have a Discord account.

1. Create a Discord account if you don't have one already.
2. Create a new bot application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
3. Generate a bot token for your bot application.
   To do this, go to the "Bot" tab on the application page and click "Generate New Token".
4. Copy the bot token and save it for later.

Once you have your bot token, you can use it to connect to the Discord API and start interacting with the bot.

## Usage

To use the bot, you'll need to have a Discord server with a channel where the bot can join.

Run the bot with the following command:

```
BOT_TOKEN=<your-bot-token-here> go run main.go
```

The bot will connect to the Discord API and start listening for messages in the channel.
